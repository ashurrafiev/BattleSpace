Experimental project to test network game engine.

HOW TO RUN:
Run bs_server.bat.
Edit bs_client.bat with your user name and IP address of the computer running bs_server.bat.
Run bs_client.bat. It may take up to 1min to connect.

Use WASD to control the ship and left-click to shoot. Do not fly your ship outside the screen.

Note: connecting to a computer behind a wifi rounter will need port forwarding. You need to setup your router to forward UDP port 3377 (or whatever you use in bs_server.bat and bs_client.bat) to the game server machine.
